Part 5 - Large Language Model (LLM)
------------------------------------

For this portion I decided to use ChatGPT and it was very easy to prompt ChatGPT to create Python code for The Diet Problem. 
The LLM actually offered up python code before I excplicitly asked for code.

I have included a PDF of my conversation with ChatGPT in the repository.
